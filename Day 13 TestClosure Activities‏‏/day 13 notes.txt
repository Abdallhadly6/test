Hey there,
 
We are finally announcing the project as officially closed

Here are links to

BugTracker_v4
SystemTestPlan
The Guru99 Banking site finally comes live! Thanks to all the effort you put into identifying bugs and making the site secure. 

 

Test Closure is a good time to

Analyze the nature & type of bugs reported and share with the development team to help them improve their performance
Calculate Defect Rejection Ratio and other metrics to gauge the efficacy of the test cases you created
Have a Team Meeting to identify various lessons learned during the testing, which can be shared with other testing teams in your organization or be used by your team in future projects.
 

We would love to hear your feedback on our effort to give you an experience of a real time testing project. Do write to us!

 

Take Care

Team Guru99
