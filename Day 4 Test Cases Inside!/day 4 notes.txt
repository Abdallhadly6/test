Alright!

Here are test cases created by our experts for the 8 Manager modules discussed in the last email. link

You may argue that the above tests case looks more like Unit Test Cases and should be executed by the developers.

 

In theory,  this is correct. In practice, the developers are almost always hard pressed for time and rarely test the system thoroughly. 
Also, there could be errors resulting from differences in the development environment and the test environment (which is usually a copy of the production environment). 
So as a best practice, it's better you check for some or all unit test cases. 
Though, this approach may vary from company to company.

In our Guru99 Bank project, we will include unit test cases.

 

Integration Testing

We strongly recommend you read this tutorial on integration testing before moving ahead.

A typical software project consists of several software modules, coded by different programmers.  
Integration testing focuses on checking data communication amongst these modules.
 

Here is the Integration Test Plan prepared by our experts. link

Alright lets baseline all our test cases today. Tomorrow we start with test execution!

Pro TIP

1)Unit Testing is also called module testing or component testing

2)The format of the Module, Integration test plans is NOT Fixed. 
  There are NO universal formats. It's decided by your test organization to suit the requirements of the project. 
  Do not worry if your formats are different from ours. 
  But do check that you include all test cases/scenarios documented by our experts
