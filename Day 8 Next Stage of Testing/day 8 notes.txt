Updates on Version 3 of the site

============================

 

The development team has informed that version 3 will be available in next 2 days

This release will feature

 All modules for the Manager Role
 All modules for the Customer Role
Ideally, you need to create and execute module test cases for

Manager Role:

Change Password
Deposit
Withdrawal
Fund Transfer
Customer Role:

Balance enquiry
Fund Transfer
Mini Statement
Customized Statement
Change Password
You also need to perform integration testing for all modules.

 

This requires a mammoth effort and is typically performed by a minimum team of 5 members.

 

For our self- learning purposes,  we will ignore this step.

 

Moving on to the next phase create a System test plan. If you are new to System testing, refer this tutorial

Assignment for the day

Create a System Test Plan
Refer the SRS_v3. The client now wants a Webservice created. Create test cases to check this webservice.

Pro Tip:

1) If you check Defect # 10 in the Bug Tracker. Its status is deferred. This happens frequently during the life cycle of testing project wherein low priority & severity bugs which are taking too much time to resolve are deferred and fixed in the next phase of the project. Such bugs are also called "known issues"

2) Any big change request (like the webservice request above) changes the scope of the project and budget needs to be re-negotiated. Albeit, this task is best left to your Business Development Executives and Test Managers
