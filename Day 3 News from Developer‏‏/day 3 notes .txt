Hey there,
 
How is it going? Do we have any test cases ready yet?

Are you finding things difficult? If yes, that's good :) because, you are learning.

Currently, you are lost and have no clue, where to begin your test case creation.

You reach your supervisor/client with the problem, who in turns contacts the development team.

The development team informs that, in the first version of the banking site, 
they will implement the following modules for the Manager -

New Customer
Edit Customer
New Account
Edit Account
Delete Account
Delete Customer
Mini Statement
Customized Statement
 

This gives you a start!

 

You can forget everything else & concentrate on the above 8 modules for the Manager Role.
